## Note: Side note: For the EDA file, please try to open the file in Jupyter on local - we have a cool choropleth visualization which cannot be seen if opened directly on github! Thanks!

1. data_preprocessing_loading.ipynb : This file is the code for processing the data directly obtained for Yelp, data obtained after this will be used for further analysis
2. EDA.ipynb : This file explores and visualizes the processed data from step 1, nv_nevada_zip_codes_geo.min.json is the file which is used for the choropleth map
3. BaselineModel.ipynb: This file contains the baseline model
4. svd_model.ipynb: This file contains a model based on SVD using Stochastic gradient descent as optimization method
5. text_to_rating_feature_processing.ipynb: This file converts the text reviews to quantitative rating using NLP, this quantitative rating can be used to further improve the model. This improved model is a proposed next step.
